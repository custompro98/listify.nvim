# listify.nvim
Turn every line in a file into a quoted, comma-separated list

# Installation
Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```
use {
  'custompro98/listify.nvim'
}
```
# Why?
Ever had a list of uuids come out of your database tool like
```
uuid-1
uuid-2
uuid-3
```
but you need those suckers quoted and comma-separated like so?
```
'uuid-1', 'uuid-2', 'uuid-3'
```
Well now you can.
